# Python Algorithms

This repo contains a collection of essential algorithms and data structures implemented in Python.

Scripts with potential technical interview questions and answers are also included. Questions are listed
as bullet points under each item.

## Data Structures

1. Arrays
    - reversing array in-place
    - checking if a string is a palindrome
    - reversing and integer
    - checking if a word is an anagram
    - finding duplicate in an array of integers
2. Linked Lists
    - linked lists
    - doubly-linked lists
    - finding middle node in a linked list
    - reversing a linked list in-place
